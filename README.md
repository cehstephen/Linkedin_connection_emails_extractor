# Linkedin_connection_emails_extractor

ever wanted to easily copy the emails of your LinkedIn connections, together with their names.

I went through the instructions giving by LinkedIn and then automated the extration of the emails from the csv file I got.

Programmers can download the app and modify or run directly if needed.
Non-programmers can just download the: download_app.zip file extract and run.
